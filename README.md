# netbox-zabbix

NetBox plugin for Zabbix.


* Free software: MIT
* Documentation: https://pergus.github.io/netbox-zabbix/



### Bugs

[FIXED] Import doesn't include proxy/proxy group.

Not having a name for ZabbixConfig's makes it problematic to script.


[FIXED] Mapping ins't updated when the user change page for Devices Exclusive To NetBox.
        To update the mapping the user has to reload the page....



## Here be Dragons!

### Problem With IPs and Interfaces

Delete the IP on an interface in Zabbix doesn't work unless useip is set to 0
before removing the address. The same goes for DNS.

Delete the last interface of its type in Zabbix doesn't work unless all no
items are left that use the interface. This means that templates has to be
deleted befor removing the interface.

### Solution

| NetBox Action     | Behaviour | State     |
| ----------------- | ----------|---------- |
| Delete an IPv4 address that is associated with a ZC interface. | The IP address is removed from the ZC interface. No Zabbix sync. | Inconsistent |
| Add a new primary IPv4 address to an devm interface. |  If the devm has an interface that is associated with a ZC interface,  then add the IP address to the ZC interface. Sync with Zabbix. | Consistent |
| Delete a devm inteface that is assoicated with a ZC interface. | The ZC interface is removed. No Zabbix sync, unless last interface then disable the host in Zabbix. | Inconstitent |
| Add a new devm interface with primary IPv4. | Nothing | Inconsitent |

To fix the inconsistency with removing interfaces the user has to add an interface by hand.

Add a view that lists all inconsistent devm/hosts.
















### Todo

* Should deleting a host in zabbix that doesn't exist cause an exception?
Exception: Failed to soft delete zabbix host 11537: No host with host id '11537' found in Zabbix


[DONE] Failsafe delete - implemented Hard/Soft delete.

[DONE] DNS name changes

* What if an interface change the ip address?
  Here be dragons!

* What if a device/vm changes or deletes an interface?
  Here be dragons!
  Delete of an interface doesn't delete it in Zabbix.



[DONE] netbox_zabbix.jobs.ExceptionWithData: ('Error -32602: Invalid params., Cannot link template "AXIS Debian" to host "dk-ece007w", because its parent template "ICMP Ping" would be linked twice.', -32602)


[DONE] Should I add additional information about templates to Zabbix to make
the checks easier.


[DONE] There might a logical error in how Device/VM mapping design.
  

[DONE] The interface hostid shoud be set to the Zabbix Hostid.

* Rename 'host' in Interfaces to zconf?

[DONE] Add delete button to Agent Interfaces and SNMP Interfaces.
This took longer than expected beacuse I couldn't get it to work.
The solution was to implement bulk delete.


[DONE] Update/Delete interfaces should record the changes in the ZC change log
       and update Zabbix.

[WAIT] If a global default setting changes, should all ZC and Hosts in Z also update?
  Don't think so.


* When the implementation works for Devices, implement the corresponding code
  for Virual Machines.

* Not all interface default settings are used, e.g. snmpv3_contextname.
  So go over the import code in jobs.py and make use of the default settings.


[DONE] The helper function 'quick_add_interface' should take a Zabbix Config
  instance as argument and only add an interface. Now it also creates
  the Zabbix Config which isn't correct if we want separations of concerns.


* The date when scheduling the background job should use
  
  django.utils.timezone.now() to remove the warning:
  
  RuntimeWarning: DateTimeField Job.scheduled received a naive datetime 
  
  (2025-08-21 17:43:35.860721) while time zone support is active.

* Since the background job doesn't use the system job decorator it isn't
  started automatically by NB when the rqworker is started.
  Look into how this can be fixed.

* Go over all models and make sure that the fields doesn't have unnecessary
  null=True and blank=True settings. Many of them were added to prevent having
  to dump the database when running makemigrations.

* Should the system issue a warning when a template is removed while it is still used by a default mapping?
  Should it also block the removal?
  Blocking the removal doesnâ€™t make sense, since if the template has already been removed from Zabbix, it no longer exists anyway.
 
* Implement maintenance mode.

* Add support for IPv6primary interfaces. (Maybe)

## Features

The features the plugin provides should be listed here.

## Compatibility

| NetBox Version | Plugin Version |
|----------------|----------------|
|     4.0        |      0.1.0     |

## Installing

For adding to a NetBox Docker setup see
[the general instructions for using netbox-docker with plugins](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-docker/wiki/Using-Netbox-Plugins).

While this is still in development and not yet on pypi you can install with pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pergus/netbox-zabbix
```

or by adding to your `local_requirements.txt` or `plugin_requirements.txt` (netbox-docker):

```bash
git+https://github.com/pergus/netbox-zabbix
```

Enable the plugin in `/opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py`,
 or if you use netbox-docker, your `/configuration/plugins.py` file :

```python
PLUGINS = [
    'netbox-zabbix'
]

PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "netbox-zabbix": {},
}
```

## Notes on date conversion for Zabbix Maintenance

```python

from datetime import datetime

maintenance = {
    'maintenanceid': '1',
    'name': 'Sample',
    'maintenance_type': '0',
    'description': 'Sample Maintenance',
    'active_since': '1751493600',
    'active_till': '1751580000',
    'tags_evaltype': '0'
}

# Convert to datetime
active_since = datetime.fromtimestamp(int(maintenance['active_since']), tz=timezone.utc)
active_till = datetime.fromtimestamp(int(maintenance['active_till']), tz=timezone.utc)

print(f"Active Since: {active_since}")
print(f"Active Till: {active_till}")
```

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone

# Your datetime object (e.g., in UTC)
dt = datetime(2025, 8, 1, 1, 0, 0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)

# Convert to Unix timestamp
unix_timestamp = int(dt.timestamp())

print(unix_timestamp)  # â†’ 1751493600
````

Converting a Django datetime to a Zabbix-compatible Unix timestamp
```python
from django.utils import timezone

# Get a timezone-aware datetime (UTC or local based on settings)
dt = timezone.now()

# Convert to Unix timestamp
unix_timestamp = int(dt.timestamp())
````

Converting a specific datetime to a timestamp using Django's timezone

```python
from django.utils import timezone
from datetime import datetime

# Define a naive datetime
naive_dt = datetime(2025, 8, 1, 1, 0, 0)

# Make it timezone-aware using Django settings
aware_dt = timezone.make_aware(naive_dt)

# Convert to Unix timestamp
timestamp = int(aware_dt.timestamp())
```
